  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="reveal">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am an Artificial Intelligence graduate from the University of Jeddah with a GPA of 4.31/5.
      I have a strong interest in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing,
      and I am also building a solid foundation in cybersecurity.
      I am currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification to strengthen my understanding
      of security principles, risk management, and secure system design.
      I enjoy building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and support better
      decision-making, especially in enterprise and financial environments.
